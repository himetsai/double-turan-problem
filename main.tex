\chapter{Introduction}

Let $\dex(n, m, F)$ be the maximum possible sum of the number of edges over $m$ subgraphs $G_1, \ldots, G_m$ on the same vertex set $[n]$, with the constraint that $E(G_i) \cap E(G_j)$ does not contain graph $F$ for $i \neq j$. Our goal is to determine $\dex(n, m, F)$ for different forbidden graphs $F$. A trivial construction with $G_1 = K_n$ and $G_2, \ldots, G_m$ to be extremal graphs for $F$ yields the lower bound $\binom{n}{2} + (m - 1)\ex(n, F)$. In this work, we use this bound as a benchmark to either show the tightness of $\dex(n, m, F)$ or to provide a better bound.

Additionally, we are also interested in a more restrictive version where $G_1, \ldots, G_m$ are induced subgraphs of $G_1 \cup \cdots \cup G_m$. We denote $\dex^*(n, m, F)$ as the maximum possible sum of the number of edges over $m$ induced subgraphs $G_1, \ldots, G_m$ on the same vertex set $[n]$ such that $E(G_i) \cap E(G_j)$ does not contain graph $F$ for $i \neq j$. The trivial construction by taking $G_1, \ldots, G_m$ to be extremal graphs for $F$ yields the lower bound $m \cdot \ex(n, F)$. This is the benchmark we use to determine $\dex^*(n, m, F)$.

In this work, we will first discuss the induced case, and then shift our focus to the general case. At the end, we will discuss the case where $F$ is bipartite.

\section{Definitions and Notation}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. Let $V(G) = V$ denote the vertex set and $E(G) = E$ denote the edge set of $G$. We note by $v(G) = |V|$ the number of vertices and $e(G) = |E|$ the number of edges in $G$. For vertex $v \in V(G)$, we denote by $N_G(v) = \{u \in V(G) : \{u, v\} \in E(G)\}$ the neighborhood of $v$.

Given $G_1, \ldots, G_m$ subgraphs of $G$, we denote $G_{i_1, \ldots, i_k}$ as the subgraph of $G$ with edge set $E(G_{i_1, \ldots, i_k}) = \bigcap_{\alpha = 1}^k E(G_{\alpha})$. 

In this thesis, we reserve $n$ to denote the number of vertices in a graph. Given a graph $F$, we denote $\ex(n, F)$ to be the extremal number for $F$ on a graph with $n$ vertices, i.e. the maximum number of edges in a $n$-vertex graph that does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. 

We call a $n$-vertex complete graph $K_n$, and a complete bipartite graph $K_{a, b}$, where $a, b$ are the size of its parts. We denote $P_n$ as a path with $n$ edges, and $C_n$ as a cycle with $n$ edges. Given graph $G, H$, define $G + H$ as the graph fully connecting $G, H$, i.e. $V(G + H) = V(G) \cup V(H)$ and $E(G + H) = E(G) \cup E(H) \cup \{\{u, v\} : u \in V(G), v \in V(H)\}$.

We also denote the set of first $n$ positive integers as $[n] = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$. Given a set $X$, we denote $2^X$ as the power set of $X$.

\chapter{Induced Version}

In this section, we assume that $G_1, \ldots, G_m$ are induced subgraphs of $G_1 \cup \cdots \cup G_m$ and $E(G_i) \cap E(G_j)$ does not contain $F$ for $i \neq j$. Here, we say that the extremal condition for $m$ subgraphs is met if $\sum_{i = 1}^m e(G_i) = \dex^*(n, m, F)$.

\textcolor{red}{TODO: add the condition for all $G_i$'s to be extremal graphs for $F$ for all $m$, and generalize to hypergraph.}

The following lemma shows that the problem can be redueced to only two graphs.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:induce-reduce}
  Let $n, m, k \in \N$ such that $2 \leq k \leq m$, and let $F$ be a graph. Then
  \[
    \dex^*(n, m, F) \leq \frac{m}{k} \cdot \dex^*(n, k, F).
  \]
  Moreover, if the extremal condition for $k$ induced subgraphs is met only when $G_1 = \cdots = G_k$, then the above equality holds and the extremal condition for $m$ induced subgraphs is met only when $G_1 = \cdots = G_m$.
\end{lemma}

\textcolor{red}{Not putting equality because I'm unsure if a construction for $k$ subgraphs can always generalize to $m$ subgraphs. For example, if $F = K_3$ and $n$ is odd, the $G_1 = K_{\left\lceil\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rceil, \left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor}$ and $G_2 = K_{\left\lceil\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rceil, \left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor} + K_1$ construction cannot be generalized to $m = n + 1$ subgraphs.}

\begin{proof}
  Let $G_1, \ldots, G_m$ be induced subgraphs of $G_1 \cup \cdots \cup G_m$ with $E(G_i) \cap E(G_j)$ not containing $F$ for $i \neq j$. Put $G_{i + m} = G_i$ for all $i \in [m]$. Then
  \[
    \sum_{i = 1}^m e(G_i) = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i = 1}^m [e(G_i) + \cdots + e(G_{i + k - 1})] \leq \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i = 1}^m \dex^*(n, k, F) = \frac{m}{k} \cdot \dex^*(n, k, F),
  \]
  which establishes the upper bound.

  Suppose $\sum_{i = 1}^k e(G_i) = \dex^*(n, k, F)$. By assumption $G_1 = \cdots = G_k$, so $e(G_i) = \dex^*(n, k, F)/k$ for $1 \leq i \leq k$. Hence, the construction $G_1 = \cdots = G_m$ meets the upperbound. On the other hand, if $G_1 \neq G_2$ then $\sum_{i = 1}^k e(G_i) < \dex^*(n, k, F)$. Since $\sum_{i = 1}^k e(G_{i + j}) \leq \dex^*(n, k, F)$ for all $j \geq 1$, we have $\sum_{i = 1}^m e(G_i) < \frac{m}{k} \cdot \dex^*(n, k, F)$. Thus the extremal condition is met only when $G_1 = \cdots = G_m$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:induce-cond}
  Let $n\geq 1$, $m \geq 2$ and $F$ be some graph. If $\ex(c, F) - \ex(c - 1, F) > \frac{c - 1}{2}$ for all $1 \leq c \leq n$, then
  \[
    \dex^*(n, m, F) = m \cdot \ex(n, F)
  \]
  and $G_1 = \cdots = G_m$ are extremal graphs for $F$ when the extremal condition is met.
\end{lemma}

\textcolor{red}{Not sure if this statement can be strengthened into if and only if. We would need to show there's no $F$ such that $\ex(c, F) - \ex(c - 1, F) \leq \frac{c - 1}{2}$ for some $c$ but $f$ has a unique maximum at $c = n$. In other words, there can not exist $F$ such that its extremal number increases slowly at some small $c$ but eventually catches up.}

\begin{proof}
  By \cref{lem:induce-reduce}, it suffices to show the case for two subgraphs. Let $G_1, G_2$ be induced subgraphs of $G_1 \cup G_2$ with $E(G_1) \cap E(G_2)$ not containing $F$. Moreover, let $C = V(G_1) \cap V(G_2)$ and put $a = |V(G_1) \backslash C|, b = |V(G_2) \backslash C|$, and $c = |C|$. Since $G_1, G_2$ are induced subgraphs, $G_1[C] = G_2[C] = G_{1, 2}$. But then $G_{1, 2}$ is $F$-free, so $e(G_1[C]) = e(G_2[C]) \leq \ex(c, F)$. This yields the inequality
  \[
    e(G_1) + e(G_2) \leq \binom{a + c}{2} + \binom{b + c}{2} - 2\left[\binom{c}{2} - \ex(c, F)\right].
  \]
  Let $f(a, b, c)$ denote the expression on the right-hand-side of the above inequality. 

  \begin{claim}
    $f$ has a unique maximum at $c = n$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}
    Suppose $b < n$. Since $\ex(c, F) - \ex(c - 1, F) > \frac{c - 1}{2}$,
    \begin{align*}
      f(a, b, c) - f(a, b + 1, c - 1)
      &= \binom{a + c}{2} - \binom{a + c - 1}{2} \\
      &\qquad - 2\left[\binom{c}{2} - \binom{c - 1}{2} - \ex(c, F) + \ex(c - 1, F)\right] \\
      &= a - c + 1 + 2[\ex(c + 1, F) - \ex(c, F)] > a \geq 0.
    \end{align*}
    Thus, $f$ is strictly increasing with respect to $c$. By symmetry, $f$ has a unique maximum at $c = n$.
  \end{proof}
  By the claim,
  \[
    e(G_1) + e(G_2) \leq 2\binom{n}{2} - 2\left[\binom{n}{2} - \ex(n, F)\right] = 2 \cdot \ex(n, F),
  \] 
  and and $G_1 = G_2 = G_{1, 2}$ are extremal graphs for $F$ on $n$ vertices.
\end{proof}

\section{Complete Graph Case}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:induce-cond-complete}
  For $n \geq 1$ and $r \geq 2$,
  \[
    \ex(n, K_{r + 1}) - \ex(n - 1, K_{r + 1}) \geq \frac{n - 1}{2},
  \]
  with equality if and only if $n$ is odd and $r = 2$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  By Turán's Theorem,
  \[
    \ex(n, K_{r + 1}) - \ex(n - 1, K_{r + 1}) = \delta(T_r(n)) = n - \left\lceil \frac{n}{r} \right\rceil \geq n - \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil.
  \]
  The result now follows.
\end{proof}

The following theorem for complete graphs with more than $3$ vertices now follows directly from \cref{lem:induce-cond} and \cref{lem:induce-cond-complete}:

\begin{theorem}
  For $n \geq 1$, $m \geq 2$, and $r \geq 3$, 
  \[
    \dex^*(n, m, K_{r + 1}) = m \cdot e(T_{r}(n)),
  \]
  and $G_1 = \cdots = G_m = T_{r}(n)$ when the extremal condition is met.
\end{theorem}

Surprisingly, the triangle case is more complicated than the case for larger complete graphs. As shown in \cref{lem:induce-cond-complete}, the condition given by \cref{lem:induce-cond} is not satisfied for all $n$ in the triangle case, and there are indeed constructions of induced subgraphs $G_1, G_2$ that meet the extremal condition but are neither equal nor both complete bipartite graphs. For odd $n$, consider $G_1 = K_{\frac{n - 1}{2}, \frac{n - 1}{2}}$ and $G_2 = K_{\frac{n - 1}{2}, \frac{n - 1}{2}} + K_1$. The number of edges over $G_1, G_2$ is $\frac{(n - 1)^2}{2} + n - 1 = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} = 2\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4}\right\rfloor$, which meets the benchmark construction of two complete bipartite graphs. Hence, for the triangle case we have to make some comprimises.

\begin{theorem}
  For $n \geq 1$ and $m \geq 2$, 
  \[
    \dex^*(n, m, K_3) = m \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor.
  \]
  Moreover, if $n$ is even or $m$ is odd, then the extremal condition is met only when $G_1 = G_2$ are complete balanced bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices. Otherwise, the extremal condition is met only when either $G_1 = G_2 = K_{\frac{n + 1}{2}, \frac{n - 1}{2}}$ or $G_1 = K_{\frac{n - 1}{2}, \frac{n - 1}{2}}$ and $G_2 = K_{\frac{n - 1}{2}, \frac{n - 1}{2}} + K_1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  By \cref{lem:induce-cond} and \cref{lem:induce-cond-complete}, we are done if $n$ is even, so we may assume that $n$ is odd. We first show the following claim.

  \begin{claim}
    $\dex^*(n, 2, K_3) = 2\left\lfloor\frac{n^2}{4}\right\rfloor$, and the extremal condition is met only when either $G_1 = G_2 = K_{\frac{n + 1}{2}, \frac{n - 1}{2}}$ or $G_1 = K_{\frac{n - 1}{2}, \frac{n - 1}{2}}$ and $G_2 = K_{\frac{n - 1}{2}, \frac{n - 1}{2}} + K_1$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}
    Let $a, b, c$, and $f(a, b, c)$ be defined as in the proof of \cref{lem:induce-cond}. Then
    \begin{align*}
      f(a, b, c) - f(a, b + 2, c - 2)
      &= \binom{a + c}{2} - \binom{a + c - 2}{2} \\
      &\qquad - 2\left[\binom{c}{2} - \binom{c - 2}{2} - \left\lfloor\frac{c^2}{4}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{(c - 2)^2}{4}\right\rfloor\right] \\
      &= 2(a + c) + 1 - 2[2c + 1 - (c + 1)] \\
      &= 2a + 1 > 0.
    \end{align*}
    Hence, $f$ attains its maximum of $2\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor$ when $c = n$ or $n - 1$, that is, $a + b \leq 1$. Thus $\dex^*(n, 2, K_3) \leq 2\left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor$. Assume that $a = 0$. When $c = n$, $G_1 = G_2 = G_{1, 2}$ are extremal graphs for $K_3$, which is the complete balanced bipartite graph on $n$ vertices. When $c = n - 1$, $G_1 = G_{1, 2} = K_{\frac{n - 1}{2}, \frac{n - 1}{2}}$ and 
    $G_2$ must be a copy of $G_1$ with all vertices adjacent to the only remaining vertex, i.e. $G_2 = G_1 + K_1$, to meet the extremal number.
  \end{proof}
  By \cref{lem:induce-reduce} and the above claim, $\dex^*(n, m, K_3) = m \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor$. It remains to show that for odd $m$, $G_1 = \cdots = G_m = K_{\frac{n + 1}{2}, \frac{n - 1}{2}}$ when the extremal condition is met. Suppose not. Then the claim guarantees $G_i = K_{\left\lceil\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rceil, \left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor} + K_1$ for some $i$. Put $G_{m + i} = i$. By applying the claim repeatedly, 
  \begin{align*}
    G_i &= K_{\left\lceil\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rceil, \left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor} + K_1 \\
    G_{i + 1} &= K_{\left\lceil\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rceil, \left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor} \\
    G_{i + 2} &= K_{\left\lceil\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rceil, \left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor} + K_1 \\
    &\qquad\quad \vdots \\
    G_{i + m} &= K_{\left\lceil\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rceil, \left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor},
  \end{align*}
  as $m$ is odd. But then $G_{i + m} = G_i = K_{\left\lceil\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rceil, \left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor}$, and this contradiction completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\section{Non-bipartite $F$}

\begin{theorem}
  Suppose $F$ is $(r + 1)$-colorable, with $r \geq 2$. For large enough $n$,
  \[
    \dex^*(n, n, F) = n \cdot \ex(n, F).
  \]
  In particular, the extremal number is reached only if $G_1 = G_2 = \cdots = G_n$ are $n$-vertex extremal graphs for $F$.
\end{theorem}

By the same argument as in Theorem 2.1, it suffices to prove the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}
  Let $F$ be $(r + 1)$-colorable, with $r \geq 2$. Suppose $E(G_1) \cap E(G_2)$ does not include $F$. For large enough $n$,
  \[
    e(G_1) + e(G_2) \leq 2 \cdot \ex(n, F),
  \]
  with equality if and only if $G_1 = G_2$ are $n$-vertex extremal graphs for $F$, unless $n$ is odd, $G_1$ is an $(n - 1)$-vertex extremal graph for $F$, and $G_2 = G_1 + K_1$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $C = V(G_1) \cap V(G_2)$, $A = V(G_1) \backslash C$, and $B = V(G_2) \backslash C$. Put $a = |A|$, $b = |B|$, $c = |C|$. Since $G_1, G_2$ are induced graphs, $E(G_1[C]) = E(G_2[C]) = E(G[C]) = E(G_i) \cap E(G_j)$, which is $F$-free. Hence, 
  \begin{gather}
    e(G_1) + e(G_2) \leq \binom{a + c}{2} +  \binom{b + c}{2} - 2\left[\binom{c}{2} - \ex(c, F)\right].
  \end{gather}
  Define $f(a, b, c)$ as the function on the right-hand-side of (2.2). We show that $f(a, b, c)$ attains its maximum at $a = b = 0$ and $c = n$. 

  \begin{claim}
    If $c \leq \frac{n}{2}$, then $f(a, b, c) < 2 \cdot \ex(n, F)$.
  \end{claim}

  \begin{proof}
    Write $c = kn$ for some $k \in [0, 1/2]$. Since
    \[
      f(a, b, kn) \leq 2\binom{(1 - k)n/2}{2} - 2\left[\binom{kn}{2} - \ex(kn, F)\right],
    \]
    it suffices to show that
    \[
      \ex(n, F) - \ex(c, F) > \binom{(1 - k)n/2}{2} - \binom{kn}{2}
    \]
    for all $k \in [0, 1/2]$. By the Erdős-Stone theorem, $\ex(n, F) = \left(1 - \frac{1}{r}\right)\frac{n^2}{2} + o(n^2)$ and so the left-hand-side is at least
    \[
      \ex(n, F) - \ex(c, F) \geq \ex(n, F) - \ex(n/2, F) \geq \left(1 - \frac{1}{r}\right)\left(\frac{n^2}{2} - \frac{n^2}{8}\right) - o(n^2) \geq \frac{3n^2}{16} - o(n^2).
    \]
    On the right-hand-side, 
    \[
      \binom{(1 - k)n/2}{2} - \binom{kn}{2} = (1 - 2k - 3k^2)\frac{n^2}{8} + o(n^2) \leq \frac{n^2}{8} + o(n^2).
    \]
    Combining the above inequalities now yields the claim, as $n$ is large.
  \end{proof}
  Thus we may assume that $c > \frac{n}{2}$. A theorem of Simonovits states that for large enough $n$, $\text{ex}(n, F) = \text{ex}(n, K_{r + 1}) + \text{ex}(n, \tilde{F})$, where $\tilde{F}$ is the family of residue subgraphs of $F$ after $F$ is embedded into $T_r(n)$. This implies 
  \[
    \text{ex}(n + 1, F) - \text{ex}(n, F) \geq \text{ex}(n, K_{r + 1}) - \text{ex}(n + 1, K_{r + 1}),
  \]
  and so
  \[
    f(a, b - 2, c + 2) - f(a, b, c) \geq 2a - 2c - 1 + 2[\ex(c + 2, K_{r + 1}) - \ex(c, K_{r + 1})].
  \]
  Since $\ex(c + 1, K_{r + 1}) - \ex(c, K_{r + 1}) \geq c - \left\lfloor \frac{c}{r} \right\rfloor \geq c - \left\lfloor \frac{c}{2} \right\rfloor$, we have
  \[
    \ex(c + 2, K_{r + 1}) - \ex(c, K_{r + 1}) \geq c + 1 - \left\lfloor \frac{c + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + c - \left\lfloor \frac{c}{2} \right\rfloor = c + 1,
  \]
  and thus 
  \[
    f(a, b - 2, c + 2) - f(a, b, c) \geq 2a + 1 > 0.
  \]

  By symmetry, we also have $f(a - 2, b, c + 2) > f(a, b, c)$. Thus, $f$ attains its maximum when $c$ is $n - 1$ or $n$. Equation (2.2) now yields, 
  \begin{align*}
    e(G_1) + e(G_2) \leq \max\left[2 \cdot \ex(n, F), 2 \cdot \ex(n - 1, F) + n - 1\right].
  \end{align*}
  Assume that $a = 0$. Since
  \begin{align}
    2 \cdot \ex(n, F) - 
    [2 \cdot \ex(n - 1, F) &+ n - 1] \nonumber \\
    &\geq 2[\ex(n, K_{r + 1}) - \ex(n - 1, K_{r + 1})] - n + 1 \\
    &= 2\left(n - \left\lceil \frac{n}{r} \right\rceil\right) - n + 1 \nonumber  \\
    &\geq n + 1 - 2\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil \geq 0,  \nonumber 
  \end{align}
  we have
  \[
    e(G_1) + e(G_2) \leq 2 \cdot \ex(n, F).
  \]
  If $c = n$, the equality holds only if $G_1 = G_2$ are $n$-vertex extramal graphs for $F$. Suppose $c = n - 1$ and the equality holds. Observe that equation (2.3) is equal to zero only when $r = 2$ and $n$ is odd. Thus if $c = n - 1$, then the equality could only be achieved when $r = 2$, $n$ is odd, $G_1$ is an $(n - 1)$-vertex extremal graph for $F$, and $G_2 = G_1 + K_1$.
\end{proof}

\chapter{General Version}

\textcolor{red}{TODO: add introduction.}

\begin{theorem}
  For all $n$ and graph $F$,
  \[
    \dex(n, m, F) = m(1 + o(1))\ex(n, F)
  \]
  as $m \to \infty$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $r = v(F)$. Pick $\epsilon > 0$. Reorder $G_1, \ldots, G_m$ so that $G_1, \ldots, G_{m'}$ are all the $G_i$'s containing at least $(1 + \epsilon)\text{ex}(n, F)$ edges. A theorem of Simonovits states that $G$ contains at least $\delta n^r$ copies of $F$ for some $\delta = \delta(\epsilon)$. Since there can be at most $\binom{n}{r}$ copies of $F$ across all $G_i$'s, 
  \[
    m'\delta n^{r} \leq \binom{n}{r} \leq n^r \implies m' \leq \frac{1}{\delta}.
  \]
  It now follows that
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{i = 1}^m e(G_i) 
    &= \sum_{i = 1}^{m'} e(G_i) + \sum_{i = m' + 1}^m e(G_i) \\
    &\leq \frac{1}{\delta}\binom{n}{2} + \left(m - \frac{1}{\delta}\right)(1 + \epsilon)\text{ex}(n, F) \\
    &= m\left[1 + \epsilon + \frac{1}{m\delta}\left(\frac{\binom{n}{2}}{\ex(n, F)} - (1 + \epsilon)\right)\right]\ex(n, F).
  \end{align*}
  Since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, the result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  For large enough $n$, suppose that $G_1, \ldots, G_m$ are graphs on common vertex set $[n]$ with no copy of $F$ contained in any $k$ of the $G_i$'s. If there exists extremal $F$-free subgraph $H$ on $n$ vertices such that $\binom{m}{k}\Delta(H) = o(n^{1/2})$, then
  \[
    \dex(n, m ,F) = (k - 1)\binom{n}{2} + \ex(n, F)\binom{m}{k}.
  \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  For $S \subseteq [m]$, let $E_S$ denote the set of edges that are contained in exactly $\{G_i\}_{i \in S}$. Then 
  \[
    \sum_{i = 1}^m e(G_i) = \sum_{S \subseteq [m]} |S||E_S| \leq (k - 1)\binom{n}{2} + \sum_{S \subseteq [m], |S| \geq k} (|S| - k + 1)|E_S|.
  \]
  Let $A_S = \bigcup_{T \supseteq S} E_T$, i.e. the set of edges that are contained in all $G_i$ with $i \in S$. When $|S| \geq k$, the edge set $A_S$ is $F$-free and thus 
  \[
    \sum_{T \supseteq S} |E_T| \leq \text{ex}(n, F).
  \]
  Hence,
  \[
    \sum_{\substack{S \subseteq [m] \\ |S| \geq k}} (|S| - k + 1)|E_S| = \sum_{\substack{S \subseteq [m], \\ |S| = k}} \sum_{T \subseteq S} \frac{(|T| - k + 1)|E_T|}{\binom{|T|}{k}} \leq \sum_{\substack{S \subseteq [m], \\ |S| = k}} \sum_{T \subseteq S} |E_T| \leq \binom{m}{k}\text{ex}(n, F),
  \]
  as each $T \in [m]$ with $|T| \geq k$ is counted $\binom{|T|}{k}$ times in total and $|T| - k + 1 \leq \binom{|T|}{k}$. This proves the upper bound.

  Now we show the bound is tight. In particular, we need to show there exists a construction such that the graph with edge set $E_S$ is an extremal $F$-free graph, for all $S \subseteq [m]$ of size $k$. Let $M = \binom{m}{k}$ and $H_1, \ldots, H_M$ be copies of an extremal $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices with $\Delta(H_i) = o(n^{1/2})$ for all $i$. It suffices to show that we can embed each $H_i$ onto $[n]$ such that their edge sets are pairwise disjoint. We begin by an arbitrary embedding of each $H_i$ and iteratively decrease the number of intersecting edges. Define a $(u, v, i)$-swap by swapping the embedding of vertex $u$ and $v$ of $H_i$, i.e. replacing each edge $\{u, w\} \in E(H_i)$ with the edge $\{u, w\}$ and each edge $\{v, w\} \in E(H_i)$ with the edge $\{v, w\}$. This perserves the type of isomorphism of $H_i$. Given a vertex $v$, let $N(v) = N_{H_1}(v) \cup \cdots \cup N_{H_M}(v)$. Suppose there exists an intersecting edge $\{u, w\} \in E(H_i) \cap E(H_j)$. Since $|N(u)|
  \leq M \cdot \Delta(H_i) = o(n^{1/2})$, $|N(u) \cup N(N(u))| = o(n)$ so there exists a vertex $v \notin N(u) \cup N(N(u))$. Since $N(u) \cap N(v) = \emptyset$, performing a $(u, v, i)$-swap reduces the number of intersecting edges. The result now follows from iterating this process.
\end{proof}


\section{Triangle $F$}

Consider $F$ to be a triangle. Simply counting the number of triangles in each $G_i$ shows the following:

\begin{theorem}
  For all $n, m$ and $\epsilon > 0$,
  \[
    \dex(n, m, K_3) < \left(m \cdot \frac{1 + \epsilon}{4} + \frac{1}{2\epsilon} - \frac{1}{2}\right)n^2.
  \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{claim}
	There are less than $\frac{2}{\epsilon}$ number of $G_i$'s with at least $(1 + \epsilon)\frac{n^2}{4}$ edges.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose $e(G_i) \geq (1 + \epsilon)\frac{n^2}{4}$ for $1\leq i \leq k$. Let $K_3(G)$ denote the number of triangles in graph $G$. By the Moon-Moser inequality,
	\[
		K_3(G_i) \geq \epsilon(1 + \epsilon)\frac{n^3}{12}.
	\]
	Since there are no overlapping traingles from different $G_i$'s, 
	\[
		\binom{n}{3} \geq \sum_{i = 1}^k K_3(G_i) \geq \frac{\epsilon(1 + \epsilon)}{12}kn^3.
	\]
	Rearranging yields $k < \frac{2}{\epsilon}$.
\end{proof}

By the claim, 
\[
  \sum_{i = 1}^m e(G_i) < \frac{2}{\epsilon}\binom{n}{2} + \left(m - \frac{2}{\epsilon}\right)(1 + \epsilon)\frac{n^2}{4} \leq m(1 + \epsilon)\frac{n^2}{4} + (1 - \epsilon)\frac{n^2}{2\epsilon},
\]
which proves Theorem 3.3.

When $m = 2$, 
\[
	e(G_1) + e(G_2) \leq \binom{n}{2} + e(G_{1, 2}) \leq \binom{n}{2} + \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor,
\]
which meets the benchmark bound and so $\dex(n, 2, K_3) = \binom{n}{2} + \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor$.

This result is also true for $m = 3$:

\begin{proposition}
  For all $n$,
  \[
    \dex(n, 3, K_3) = \binom{n}{2} + \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{2} \right\rfloor.
  \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Define $H_k \subseteq G$ be the graph with edges contained in at least $k$ number of $G_i$'s and note that $e(G_1) + e(G_2) + e(G_3) = e(H_1) + e(H_2) + e(H_3)$. Thus it suffices to show that $e(H_2) + e(H_3) \leq \frac{n^2}{2}$. Notice $H_2$ must not contain any triangles with two edges in $H_3$, so
  \[
    e(H_2) + e(H_3) \leq \binom{n}{2} + e(H_3) - |\{\{u, v\} : u \neq v, N_{H_3}(u) \cap N_{H_3}(v) \neq \emptyset\}|.
  \]
  Let $H'_3$ be the graph with the same vertex set as $H_3$ and edge set $\{\{u, v\} : u \neq v, N_{H_3}(u) \cap N_{H_3}(v) \neq \emptyset\}$. It suffices to show that $\frac{n}{2} \geq e(H_3) - e(H'_3)$. 

  Let $d_1 \geq d_2 \geq \cdots \geq d_n$ and $f_1 \geq f_2 \geq \cdots \geq f_n$ each be the degree sequence of $H_3$ and $H_3'$, respectively. We show that $f_i \geq d_i - 1$ for all $i$. Let $v_i$ denote the vertex in $H$ with degree $d_i$ and $u_i$ be the vertex in $H$ with degree $f_i$. Let $S_i = |N_{H_3}(v_1) \cup \cdots \cup N_{H_3}(v_i)|$. Since 
  \[
    \sum_{u \in S_i} d_{H_3}(u) \geq d_1 + \cdots + d_i,
  \]
  we have that $|S_i| \geq i$. But then $S_i \backslash \{u_1, \ldots, u_{i - 1}\}$ is non-empty, and every $u \in S_i$ has degree $d_{H_3'}(u) \geq d_i - 1$. Hence, $f_i \geq d_i - 1$ for all $i$, which yields
  \[
    e(H_3') = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i = 1}^n f_i \geq \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i = 1}^n (d_i - 1) = e(H_3) - \frac{n}{2}.
  \]
\end{proof}

However, the bound in Proposition 3.1 is not tight for $m \geq 4$, as shown in the following graph:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (4, 2) to node[midway, above] {$123$} (-4, 2); \draw (-4, 2) to node[midway, left] {$124$} (-1, -1); \draw (-1, -1) to node[midway, above] {$34$} (1, -1); \draw (1, -1) to node[midway, right] {$124$} (4, 2); \draw (0, 1) to node[midway, below] {$234$} (4, 2); \draw (0, 1) to node[midway, below] {$134$} (-4, 2); \draw (0, 1) to node[midway, left] {$123$} (-1, -1); \draw (0, 1) to node[midway, right] {$123$} (1, -1); \draw[bend left=80] (4, 2) to node[midway, right] {$134$} (-1, -1); \draw[bend right=80] (-4, 2) to node[midway, left] {$234$} (1, -1);

    \foreach \x/\y in {0/1, 4/2, 1/-1, -1/-1, -4/2} { \fill (\x, \y) circle (2pt); }
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \\
  \small{The number on each edge denotes the set of $G_i$'s that contain the edge.}
\end{center}
The above graph contains $29$ edges, which exceeds the bound $\binom{5}{2} + 3 \lfloor \frac{5^2}{4} \rfloor = 28$ by $1$. By blowing up the above graph, we can construct a graph with $n \in 10\mathbb{Z}$ vertices that contains
\[
  5\binom{n/5}{2} + 29 \cdot \frac{(n/5)^2}{4}
\]
edges, which exceeds the bound $\binom{n}{2} + 3\lfloor\frac{n^2}{4}\rfloor$ by $n^2/100$. 

\section{Bipartite $F$}

In this section, we discuss the case where $F$ is bipartite. In particular, we focus on the cases where $F \subseteq K_{2, 2}$ is $P_2$, a path of length $2$, or $M_2$, a matching with two edges.

\begin{theorem}
  \[
    \dex(n, m, P_2) \leq \left(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)\right)n^{2}\sqrt{m}
  \]
  as $n \to \infty$ or $m \to \infty$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Since there are no overlapping $P_2$'s in different $G_i$'s, 
  \[
    \sum_{i = 1}^m \#\{P_2 \subseteq G_i\} \leq \#\{P_2 \subseteq G\}
  \]
  For each $G_i$, each vertex $v$ in $G_i$ and two of its neighbors form one unique $P_2$, so
  \[
    \#\{P_2 \subseteq G_i\} = \sum_{v \in V(G_i)} \binom{d_{G_i}(v)}{2}.
  \]
  And by Jensen's inequality,
  \[
    \sum_{v \in V(G_i)} \binom{d_{G_i}(v)}{2} \geq n\binom{d_{G_i}(v)/n}{2} = n\binom{2e(G_i)/n}{2} \geq \frac{2(e(G_i))^2}{n} - e(G_i).
  \]
  On the other hand, since each three vertices in $G$ can form at most three $P_2$'s, 
  \[
    \#\{P_2 \subseteq G\} \leq 3\binom{n}{3} \leq \frac{n^3}{2}.
  \]
  Combining the above inequalities yields
  \[
    \frac{2m}{n}\left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^m e(G_i)\right)^2 - \sum_{i = 1}^m e(G_i) \overset{Jensen's}{\leq} \sum_{i = 1}^m \frac{2(e(G_i))^2}{n} - e(G_i) \leq \frac{n^3}{2},
  \]
  and solving the quadratic equation gives
  \[
    \sum_{i = 1}^m e(G_i) \leq mn \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{4n^2/m + 1}}{4} =  \left(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)\right)n^{2}\sqrt{m},
  \]
  as $n \to \infty$ or $m \to \infty$.
\end{proof}

When $m = n$, the following projective plane construction shows the above bound is tight asymptotically:

\begin{theorem}
  \[
    \dex(n, n, P_2) = \left(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)\right)n^{5/2},
  \]
  as $n \to \infty$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  It suffices to show the tightness of the bound in Theorem 3.5. Consider a finite projective plane of order $q$. The projective plane has $n = q^2 + q + 1$ points and $n$ lines. Let $S_1, \ldots, S_n \subseteq [n]$ be the $n$ lines of the projective plane. Note that each line $S_i$ contains $q + 1$ points, and the intersection of any two distinct lines $S_i, S_j$ contains $|S_i \cap S_j| = 1$ point. Define $G_1, \ldots, G_n$ to be graphs on $[n]$, each with edge set $E(G_i) = \{\{j, k\} \subseteq [n] : j \neq k, \, j + k \in S_i \mod n\}$. Note that the intersection of distinct $G_i$, $G_j$ is $P_2$ free: since $|S_i \cap S_j| = 1$, if $\{a, b\}, \{a, c\} \in E(G_i) \cap E(G_j)$, then $a + b = a + c$ so $b = c$. We now count the number of edges in $G_1, \ldots, G_n$. Since $|S_i| = q + 1$, for each point $j \in [n]$, there are $q + 1$ choices for $k \in [n]$ such that $j + k \in S_i$. But then we have to avoid counting the same edge twice and loops, so the number of edges in $G_i$ is
  \[
    e(G_i) = \frac{n(q + 1) - \#\text{loops counted for } G_i}{2}.
  \]
  If $j \in [n]$ is even, then $k = j/2$ is the unique number in $[n]$ such that $k + k = j \mod n$. If $j \in [n]$ is odd, then $k = (n + j)/2$ is the unique number in $[n]$ such that $k + k = j \mod n$, as $n$ is even. Hence, for each $j \in S_i$, there exists a unique $k \in [n]$ such that $k + k = j \mod n$, and thus
  \[
    \#\text{loops counted for } G_i = |S_i| = q + 1.
  \]
  Since $q + 1 = (1 + o(1))n^{1/2}$, the number of edges in $G_1, \ldots, G_n$ is
  \[
    \sum_{i = 1}^n e(G_i) = n \cdot \frac{n(q + 1) - (q + 1)}{2} = \left(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)\right)n^{5/2},
  \]
  as $n \to \infty$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  For all $n, m$,
  \[
    \dex(n, m, M_2) \leq n^{5/2}.
  \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Notice that $\#\{M_2 \subseteq G\} = \binom{e(G_i)}{2}$. On the other hand, each four vertices in $G$ can form at most three $M_2$'s, so $\#\{M_2 \subseteq G\} \leq 3\binom{n}{4} \leq \frac{n^4}{8}$. By the same argument as in Theorem 3.4, we have 
  \[
    \sum_{i = 1}^n \binom{e(G_i)}{2} = \sum_{i = 1}^n \#\{M_2 \subseteq G_i\} \leq \#\{M_2 \subseteq G\} \leq \frac{n^4}{8}.
  \]
  By Jensen's inequality,
  \[
    \sum_{i = 1}^n \binom{e(G_i)}{2} \geq n\binom{\sum_{i = 1}^n e(G_i)/n}{2} = \frac{1}{2n}\left[\left(\sum_{i = 1}^n e(G_i)\right)^2 - n\sum_{i = 1}^n e(G_i)\right].
  \]
  Combining the above inequalities yields
  \[
    \left(\sum_{i = 1}^n e(G_i)\right)^2 - n\sum_{i = 1}^n e(G_i) \leq \frac{n^5}{4},
  \]
  and solving the quadratic inequality gives
  \[
    \sum_{i = 1}^n e(G_i) \leq n^{5/2}.
  \]
\end{proof}

We may obtain an exact result if we forbid both $P_2$ and $M_2$ at the same time:

\begin{theorem}
  For all $n, m$,
  \[
    \dex(n, m, \{P_2, M_2\}) = n^2 - n.
  \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Denote the set of $G_i$'s as $\{G_i\} = \{G_1, \ldots, G_n\}$, and the set of distinct pairs of $G_i$'s as $\{G_i\}^2 = \{\{G_j, G_k\} : j \neq k\}$. Consider the bipartite graph $H$ with vertex set $V(H) = \{G_i\} \sqcup E(K_n)$ and edge set $E(H) = \{\{G_j, e\} \in \{G_i\} \times E(K_n) : e \in G_j\}$. Define $\phi: \{G_i\}^2 \to 2^{E(K_n)}$ by sending each $\{G_j, G_k\}$ to their common edge set $E(G_j) \cap E(G_k)$. Notice that each distinct $G_j, G_k$ have at most one edge in common, so $|\phi(G_j, G_k)| \leq 1$. On the other hand, each edge $e \in E(G)$ can be obtained via $\phi$ by $\binom{d_H(e)}{2}$ possible distinct pairs $(G_j, G_k)$, and thus $|\phi^{-1}(e)| = \binom{d_H(e)}{2}$. But then
  \[
    \binom{n}{2} \geq \sum_{(G_j, G_k) \in \{G_i\}^2} |\phi(G_j, G_k)| = \sum_{e \in E(K_n)} |\phi^{-1}(e)| = \sum_{e \in E(K_n)} \binom{d_H(e)}{2}.
  \]
  By Jensen's inequality,
  \[
    \sum_{e \in E(K_n)} \binom{d_H(e)}{2} \geq \binom{n}{2}\binom{\sum_{e \in E(K_n)} d_H(e)/\binom{n}{2}}{2} = \binom{n}{2}\binom{\sum_{i = 1}^n e(G_i)/\binom{n}{2}}{2}.
  \]
  Combining the above inequalities yields
  \[
    2\binom{n}{2}^2 \geq \left(\sum_{i = 1}^n e(G_i)\right)^2 - \binom{n}{2}\sum_{i = 1}^n e(G_i),
  \]
  and the result now follows from solving the quadratic inequality.

  To see that this bound is tight, consider the construction such that for each distinct $i, j \in [n]$, $E(G_i) \cap E(G_j)$ contains exactly one unique edge $e \in K_n$. The number of edges in this construction is $2\binom{n}{2} = n^2 - n$.
\end{proof}
